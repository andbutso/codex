Enfilant mes chaussons de danse, je m'apprête à danser sous le ciel d'hiver;
(Putting on my ballet shoes, I'm about to dance under the Winter sky)
The snow was about to fall next week, covering the sleepy and the woken,
Wishing a good sleep to the forest, until the next Spring
And the American perestroika. 
I wish the cold weather would never end, 
yet I have more ideas of what is to come in the uncertain future
